# 🧠 Personality Disorder Detection from Text using NLP and AI Counseling

A web-based application that leverages **BERT-based text classification** and **AI-powered chatbot counseling** to detect and provide support for various personality disorders based on social media-like text inputs. This project uses **Flask**, **TensorFlow**, and **LangChain-Groq** (LLaMA 3 model) for seamless integration between mental health screening and AI-assisted conversation.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🧠 **Text Classification** using a fine-tuned BERT model to identify:
  - Normal
  - Suicidal
  - Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)
  - Bipolar Disorder
  - Schizotypal Personality Disorder
- 🤖 **Counseling Assistant** with tailored responses using Groq's LLaMA 3.3 model.
- 📊 **Probability Scores** for prediction confidence.
- 🔁 **Progressive Conversation** with automated mental health insights after every few user inputs.
- 🔐 Session-based architecture for personalized interaction.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/personality-disorder-detector.git
cd personality-disorder-detector
```

### 2. Install Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Add Tokenizer and Weights
Place the tokenizer files in:
```
./tokenizer/content/tokenizer/
```
Ensure the model weights file `bert_classifier_weights.h5` is in the root directory.

### 4. Set API Key
Update `GROQ_API_KEY` in `bert.py` and `chat.py` with your valid Groq API key.

### 5. Run the Apps
Run the classifier and counseling system:
```bash
python bert.py
```

Run the progressive therapy chatbot (optional):
```bash
python chat.py
```
